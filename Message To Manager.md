Hey Team,

I’ve been diving into our data and migrating it into a structured model. Throughout the process I ran into several issues that will impact the accuracy of our AI/ML models, dashboards, reports, and products. I’d love your input on a few questions:

- Are we leaning more toward capturing a large quantity of data—even if some is incomplete—or do we prefer fewer but more accurate data points?  
- Which data fields are absolutely essential for our business processes (e.g., brand IDs, user creation dates, purchase totals)?
- Are there data sources or external APIs we can leverage to fill in the blanks or confirm ambiguous values?
- How do you (and our customers) currently use these data points? Are there specific dashboards, machine learning models, or compliance rules we must consider?

So far I have developed pipelines to refine the data, but there's a lot more I can get out of it. Tackling any one of these can as much as double the amount of data I can send through, or double it's quality.

Thanks.
