# Business Requirements  

## Overview  
The business requirements stage is the foundation of the data analytics process. It defines the key business questions that the analysis must answer and ensures alignment between stakeholder needs and data capabilities. This stage drives the data model, exploration, and subsequent analysis.  

## Role in the Analytics Process  
This is the first of five stages in the data analytics workflow:  

1. **Business Requirements** - Define key business questions and expected outputs  
2. **Data Exploration** - Assess data availability, structure, and integrity  
3. **Data Solution** - Develop SQL queries and transformations to answer business questions  
4. **Data Validation** - Verify accuracy and consistency of query results  
5. **Data Visualization** - Present findings through reports and dashboards  

## Business Questions  
The analysis must answer the following stakeholder-driven questions:  

- What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for the most recent month  
- How does the ranking of the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for the recent month compare to the ranking for the previous month  
- When considering average spend from receipts with rewardsReceiptStatus of Accepted or Rejected which is greater  
- When considering total number of items purchased from receipts with rewardsReceiptStatus of Accepted or Rejected which is greater  
- Which brand has the most spend among users who were created within the past 6 months  
- Which brand has the most transactions among users who were created within the past 6 months  

## Expected Outputs  
- SQL queries that retrieve data efficiently to answer the questions  
- Clear definitions of business metrics to be used in the analysis  
- A structured data model that supports these queries  

## Next Steps 
1. **Exploration** - Explore to understand the data.
2. **Solutioning** - Develop queries and models.  
3. **Validation** - Ensure accuracy.  
4. **Visualization** - Present findings.
