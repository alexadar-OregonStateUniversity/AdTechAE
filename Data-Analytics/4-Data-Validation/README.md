# Data Validation

## Overview  
The validation stage ensures that the results from the solution stage meet business objectives. This step assesses data accuracy, verifies consistency, and determines if further refinement is needed before moving forward.  

## Key Tasks  

1. **Evaluate Results**  
   - Compare query/model outputs against expected business requirements.  
   - Check if the results align with predefined success criteria.  

2. **Verify Data Quality**  
   - Identify inconsistencies, outliers, or missing values.  
   - Ensure that transformations and calculations were performed correctly.  

3. **Review Process**  
   - Confirm that all steps were executed properly.  
   - Reassess methodology if discrepancies arise.  

4. **Determine Next Steps**  
   - If results are valid, proceed to visualization.  
   - If issues are found, iterate back through the previous stages as needed.  

## Deliverables  
- A validated dataset ready for visualization.  
- Documentation of any adjustments or refinements made during validation.  

## Next Steps  
1. **Visualization** - Present insights effectively.
