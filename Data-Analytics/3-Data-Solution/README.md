# Data Solution 

## Overview  
In this stage, models and queries are built to derive insights from the data. The goal is to develop structured, efficient solutions that directly answer the business questions.  

## Key Tasks  

1. **Define the Approach**  
   - Choose the appropriate modeling method (SQL, statistical, or machine learning).  
   - Identify the necessary transformations and joins.  

2. **Build and Execute Queries**  
   - Develop SQL queries to generate insights.  
   - Structure queries for efficiency and reusability.  

3. **Develop Analytical Models**  
   - Apply statistical or machine learning techniques if required.  
   - Train, test, and refine models based on accuracy.  

4. **Document and Review**  
   - Ensure queries align with business requirements.  
   - Optimize performance for scalability.  

## Deliverables  
- Finalized queries or models.  
- A structured dataset ready for validation.  

## Next Steps  
1. **Validation** - Verify accuracy and refine results.  
2. **Visualization** - Present insights effectively.
